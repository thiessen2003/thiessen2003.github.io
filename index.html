        <p>Hi, there! I am <bold>Gabriel</bold>, a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania and a blue dev at the best CS club at Penn (a.k.a Spark). I am currently studying 
           Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, but I am also quite into education, finance, and innovation. Thus, I hope to do a minor in either economics 
           or engineering entrepreneurship.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Fun fact: I was born and raised in Brazil in a relatively large city called Porto Alegre. It is quite close to Uruguay, so I spent most of chilhood sumemrs at Punta del Este. (pic below)
